# PhotoAlbum App

This is a photography album web application. The album showcases photos from various photographers inside a masonry layout, it also allows viewing of each photo, deletion and addition of new ones.
Filtering by tags and photographer is also possible within the gallery page.
Viewed photos offer information such as a description, location (linking to that city directly on google-maps) and photographer name.
